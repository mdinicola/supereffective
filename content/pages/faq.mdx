<summary>What is Supereffective?</summary>

Supereffective is a Pokémon fan site that provides a variety of tools and resources for Pokémon games.

One of our first and most popular tools is the LivingDex Tracker, which helps you keep track of all the Pokémon you've
caught and seen in the games.

We also have a Pokédex, which provides detailed information about each Pokémon, including their stats, abilities, and
moves.

<summary>How do I use the LivingDex Tracker?</summary>

The LivingDex Tracker is a tool that helps you keep track of all the Pokémon you've caught and seen in the games.

To use the LivingDex Tracker, simply create an account on Supereffective and start adding Pokémon to your collection.
You can add Pokémon by searching for them in the Pokédex and clicking the "Add to Collection" button.

Once you've added a Pokémon to your collection, you can mark it as "Caught" or "Seen" to keep track of your progress.
