              How to use the new Living Dex app (site version 2.0+) :

                    <b>Sign In: </b>
                    To use the app you have to be signed in with one of our providers (Google,
                    Twitter or Github) and
                    {ifCanAddMoreDexes(

                    if you don't have any.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When you are signed in and go to your own Dex, a toolbar will appear at the top
                    of the page.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If for some reason, you can't or don't want to sign in, you can also use our{' '}

                    is basically a visual guide like in the first version of the site.

                    <b>Pokémon Selection Mode: </b>
                    The first tool is the selection mode: single Pokémon{' '}
                    <i className={'icon-mouse-pointer'} /> or full box{' '}
                    <i className={'icon-pkg-box'} />. Selecting one or another will affect how marks
                    are applied to the Pokémon (to one or to all in a box).

                    continuous <i className={'icon-infinite'} />. In boxed, mode you will see all
                    Pokémon distributed in boxes. In continuous mode you will see all Pokémon in a
                    cleaner single list, without any gap between them, useful to see their marks and
                    images bigger with all their names.

                    <b>Check-listing and marking your Pokémon: </b>
                    The marker tool, allows you to mark your pokemon as Caught

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All non-caught
                    <i className={'icon-pkg-pokeball-outlined'} /> pokemon will be shown as shadows,
                    which visually helps to know which ones you don&#39;t have, it also avoids
                    spoilers whenever we add newly discovered Pokémon and forms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can view all marks at once by clicking on the Show button (
                    <i className={'icon-eye'} />
                    ), or hide all of them by clicking on the Show-none button (

                    In both of these show modes, you won't be applying any mark when clicking on

                    </b>
                    The Living Dex app supports many different games and for every one, there might
                    be different predefined sorting and grouping modes from which you can choose.
                    <br />
                    When you use the preset tool (
                    <i className={'icon-sync_alt'} />) you are telling the app to reorganize your
                    boxes with a different preset than the current one. The app will try to match
                    your data with the existent Pokémon in the preset, but sometimes you will see
                    that the number of storable Pokémon varies.
                    <br />
                    This is because some presets have duplicated Pokémon to be visually more
                    attractive (e.g. the box with Vivillon, it also has the base form) and some
                    other presets omit the duplication of Pokémon that are hard to find (e.g. having
                    one Arceus per type).
                    <br />
                    In any case, when a Pokémon you recorded is not found in the destination preset,
                    it will be added into a new box at the end.
