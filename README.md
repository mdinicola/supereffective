Or all in one command: `pnpm build && pnpm dev && pnpm open`

For other scripts, please check the `package.json` files.

## Software Stack

We use the following technologies, services and tools:

- We use Node v20 LTS
- pnpm v8 for package management
- Turborepo (turbo) to accelerate running scripts
- NextJS 14 + React 18 for the website
- CSS Modules for styling without styling libraries
- React Context for state management (to be replaced by Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
- MDX + [FrontMater CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) as the local/static CMS
- Next Auth, Prisma and Neon.tech PostgreSQL for authentication and dex data storage
- Vercel (Pro tier) for hosting and deployments
- GitHub for hosting static JSON dataset
- CloudFlare for caching and DNS
- Docker, PostgreSQL and Maildev for local development environment
- Other tools: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, etc.
